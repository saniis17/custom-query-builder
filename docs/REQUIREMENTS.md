## User Stories

### Epic: Configuration Management

**US-001**: As a program manager, I want to upload configuration files so that I can define the fields and structure for my scholarship program.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a valid JSON configuration file
- When I upload it to the system
- Then the system validates and loads the configuration
- And displays the available fields for query building

**US-002**: As a business analyst, I want to see validation errors clearly so that I can fix configuration issues quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given an invalid configuration file
- When I try to load it
- Then the system shows specific error messages
- And highlights the problematic sections

### Epic: Eligibility Query Building

**US-003**: As a program manager, I want to create eligibility rules visually so that I can define who qualifies for the scholarship.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a loaded configuration
- When I create eligibility rules
- Then I can select fields, operators, and values
- And combine multiple rules with AND/OR logic

**US-004**: As a business analyst, I want to set family income ranges so that I can filter candidates by economic criteria.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the family income field
- When I select "between" operator
- Then I can set minimum and maximum values
- And the system validates the range

### Epic: Ranking Query Building

**US-005**: As a program manager, I want to create scoring algorithms so that I can rank eligible candidates.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given eligible candidates
- When I create ranking rules
- Then I can define scoring methods for different fields
- And assign weights to different criteria

**US-006**: As a business analyst, I want to apply inverse scoring for income so that lower income candidates get higher scores.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a numeric field like income
- When I select inverse percentile scoring
- Then lower values receive higher scores
- And the scoring is properly weighted

### Epic: Query Export and Integration

**US-007**: As a system administrator, I want to export queries as JSON so that I can integrate them with the backend system.
